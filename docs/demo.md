我刚刚回复了一家申请 [AngelList](https://web.archive.org/web/20221006052407/http://venturehacks.com/angellist) 的初创公司，它的网站在[封闭测试版](https://web.archive.org/web/20221006052407/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Open_and_closed_beta)的墙后面:

> `"Thanks Jeff. Where's the demo? If your team isn't pedigreed (founded a company and made money for its investors) and you don't have outstanding [traction](https://web.archive.org/web/20221006052407/http://venturehacks.com/articles/plans-ndas-traction#traction), the #1 thing you have going for you is a demo. I also think closed betas are generally a bad idea. Who cares if someone sees the site? Hope you don't mind the direct feedback. Send us a demo and we can take it from there."`

除非你很出名或者是大公司，否则为什么要做封闭测试版？
